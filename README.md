## Problem

Accessing patient records across various healthcare networks such as specialist centers, general practitioners, private practices, and clinics is cumbersome and time-consuming. The traditional means, such as phone calls and emails, consume junior doctors' time and detract from patient care.

## Solution

A web app that facilitates the request and sharing of specific patient data across healthcare practices.

## Key Features

Security: Leverages existing firewall protection within healthcare practices to ensure confidentiality and security of patient records.

User-Friendly Interface: Similar to the Hotdoc homepage, the app is intuitive and requires no additional training for staff.

Search Functionality: Users can search other healthcare facilities or doctors practicing in specific locations.

Request Form: A form to request specific patient records like consultation notes, test results, last scans, medication history, etc. It includes patient identifiers and offers multiple ways to receive the requested records (email, fax, or directly through the app).

Real-Time Notifications: Upon a request, a notification appears on the requested clinic's desktop. An admin person or the patient's doctor can authorize sharing the records. If patient consent is needed, a real-time notifier can be sent to the requester.

Cloud Integration: Mentioned "Filed X (cloud drop)," it may imply integration with cloud storage, though details are not specified.

Optional Participation: Clinics can choose whether or not to use the platform, maintaining autonomy and patient privacy.

Benefits

Efficiency: Significantly reduces the time and effort required to access patient records.

Training Costs: No additional training is needed, saving both time and money.

Privacy Compliance: Does not aggregate records in the same database, acting only as a communication platform while respecting patient privacy.

Conclusion:
The proposed web app aims to streamline the process of requesting and sharing patient records across various healthcare practices. By utilizing existing security measures and offering an intuitive, real-time solution, it facilitates smoother communication, efficiency, and maintains the privacy and autonomy of participating entities. It represents a technologically savvy approach to a longstanding issue in healthcare coordination.
